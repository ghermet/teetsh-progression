## Design Improvements for TeeTsh Programmation Interface

Looking at your TeeTsh interface screenshot, I can see you have a programming programmation view with a weekly timeline structure. Given your data model (school year → schedules → periods → weeks → topics → domains), here are some UX/UI recommendations:
Current Strengths

The weekly timeline with clear date ranges is intuitive
Color-coded topics (orange, purple, pink) provide good visual hierarchy
The "+ Ajouter" buttons make content addition clear

Recommended Improvements

1. Multi-Level Navigation
   Add a breadcrumb or tab system at the top:
   School Year 2025-2026 > Schedule: Lycée Joffre > Period 1 (Sept-Oct)
2. Period Visualization
   Since periods are based on French holidays, add period boundaries:

Subtle vertical dividers between periods
Period labels (Période 1, Période 2, etc.)
Holiday indicators where periods break

3. Topic-Domain Hierarchy
   For each topic row, show domains as:

Expandable rows: Click a topic to reveal its domains underneath
Nested cards: Domains as smaller cards within topic rows
Color coding: Use topic colors with domain variations (lighter shades)

4. Enhanced Week Management

Week grouping: Group weeks by period with accordion-style expansion
Drag & drop: Allow topics to be dragged across weeks
Conflict indicators: Show when topics overlap or conflict

5. Information Density Options

Compact view: Show just topic names
Detailed view: Include domain counts, progress indicators
Planning view: Show resource allocation, teacher assignments
